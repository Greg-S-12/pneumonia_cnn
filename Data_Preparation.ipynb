    "# Preparing the Data\n",
    "This notebook will allow the user to read in the data from Kaggle and prepare it for training and testing. With a few minor changes to code, the user can change: the train/test/validation split sizes, the classes to be predicted (e.g. bacterial/viral/healthy or pneumonia/healthy), the shape of the images for analysis and more.\n",
    "I have explicitly written the code out for the reading the image data and augmentations so the reader can try to understand what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Organising the Data](#first-bullet)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Three Classes from Two\n",
    "This dataset is from kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia\n",
    "<br> The original dataset has already split the data into train, test and validation sets before splitting them into cases of Pneumonia and Normal (healthy) lungs. In reality Pneumonia can be caused by a bacterial infection or a viral one.\n",
    "<br> For this project, I wish to see if the model can solve a multi-class problem as well as a binary one. Using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify either cases of Pneumonia vs. healthy lungs, before further breaking the pneumonia class down into viral and bacterial. To do so we must create our own classes which requires splitting the images up differently to how this dataset is provided - such that there are 3 different classes: Normal (healthy), Bacterial and Viral.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Train, Test and Validation Split and Class Imbalance\n",
    "I will further create a train, test and validation split based around these classes. The test set will remained untouched and unseen until the final model is tested  in the third notebook. Validation is used during training to aid the user in avoiding overfitting of the training data.\n",
    "<br> We will also see there is a class imbalance in the dataset which will bias our algorithm in its classifcation. This also makes the accuracy metric (used to evaluate how \"good\" the model is at classifying images) misleading and not a valid representation of the true model performance.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## [Formatting the Data](#second-bullet)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resizing Images\n",
    "As the dataset is a few thousand images all with large resolution we will have to resize these such that the training of our model doesnt take too long. This will be something to consider in optimization of the model too - if transfer . learning is used (such as from VGG16) then the image will have to be of a certain shape and color scheme (grayscale or RGB).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rescaling\n",
    "This is also known as normalization. Each pixel in an image has a value of 0-255 depending on its contrast. Each image will contain a varying number of each value, meaning a different range of values -  a larger range will contribute more to the loss whereas a smaller range has a smaller contribution. When this is put into our model the network the weights update accordingly. We want each image treated equally so by scaling, we put all the values in the same range 0-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Class Imbalance](#third-bullet)\n",
    "### Image Generation\n",
    "To account for the inital class imbalance we can create new images using the data in our posession. We can do this by flipping, stretching and rotating the images - as long as the augmentation matches what could happen with an actual x-ray image.\n",
    "<br> It is important to note that in this step we will NOT be generating new data IN ADDITION to our training data, but rather we REPLACE the training data in each batch with the augmented images. This is known as \"on-the-fly\" image generation and is the most commonplace method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Weighting\n",
    "An alternative method to data generation is weighting the classes. This will bias the learning so that the undersampled classes are more heavily weighted and therefore all classes are treated equally. This restores the validity of the accuracy metric for model evaluation.\n",
    "<br> While this method has the advantages of being quicker to execute and simpler so less can go wrong, we lose out on training the model on a larger dataset so are more prone to overfitting or worse model performance (on the validation/test sets).\n",

Furthermore training these networks takes a lot of processing power so using **AWS or Google Cloud platform will greatly speed this process up** and you can get free credits when you sign up!\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the above (using git) and due to the fact that these **files are very large** it is a good idea to store these images in a new folder and put it in a **.gitignore** file so they are not committed/pushed as this is very likely to be **above the size limit** (especially if you plan on pushing your saved weights (h5) folders!!!). \n",
    "\n",
    "(Alternatively you could try using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) which acts as an 'pointer' to where the files are located without actually uploading them. However I have experienced issues with this with Git and when combining this with Google Cloud and may corrupt your git branch so I'd reccommend the .gitignore method.)"
