3 Class
--------
Predicted 3 classes using data generator for both validation and training data.

2 Class
-------
Best model
- Model which perforper had best performance on the test data.

DataGen
- Models which used a data generator for the training data but NOT validation.

Weighted
- Models which used class weightings instead of a data generator for training dataset.
- Mainly to see effect of data generator on training data and predictions.

Layers
------

Dropouts
- Added varying number of Dropout(0.3) layers to model to see effect on loss. Reduces
number of weights (30%) to zero. Should slow learning but improve overfitting.

Batch_Normalization
- Adaptive histogram equalization. Normalizes weights to reduce covariate shift
Can allow for increase in learning rate and can replace dropout layers.
